# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dylan

Mechanical/Electrical Contractor studying to pursue a career in Information Technology and Software Engineering.

I run a small web design and marketing automation company called Saturn Websites. I develop and host marketing websites, APIs, and backend services for small businesses using traditional front-end web (HTML, CSS, Javascript) and SaaS (Webflow, Netlify, Make) technologies.
